Niamh is a frontend developer at Elsewhen. After learning to code in her spare time, she switched careers from publishing to tech in 2019 and has never looked back. She loves learning new things and helping those underrepresented in tech to flourish in their careers. When she's not building web apps or hanging out at meetups, she’s often working on her swimming technique in the salty Irish Sea.
