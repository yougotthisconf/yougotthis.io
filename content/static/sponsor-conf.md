### Captioning Sponsorship

In addition to our sponsorship sponsorship packages, you may additionally sponsor our live captioning, provided by [White Coat Captioning](https://www.whitecoatcaptioning.co.uk), for £1800. There are three captioning sponsorship opportunities available, and sponsors will be highlighted as such during the event and in our custom online conference platform.

## Schedule Overview

The event is broken up into three large blocks - the first in EMEA-friendly hours, the second in America-friendly hours, and the last in APAC-friendly hours.

Each block has 12 talks, 2 half-hour breaks, and one hour-long break. Breaks will start and end with sponsor interstitials.

Between blocks is an additional hour-long break.

## Audience

For the first time since You Got This was formed, we asked monitoring questions as part of registration to our conference in January 2022. This allows us to best understand our audience. This is what we learned:

- 35.6% of our audience as self-taught developers.
- 72.9% of our audience use she/her, they/them, or multiple pronouns.
- 28.7% of our audience are early-career. 30.7% of our audience are seniors or managers+.
- 47% of the audience that attend You Got This events are considering a change in jobs.
- Our audience primarily spans the UK, USA, Ireland, Spain, and Germany.

## Inclusion

We'll keep this brief. It’s important that as many people as possible have access to our initiatives. To aid that, we:

- Pay all speakers and authors.
- Have a live captioner at all events.
- Publish videos swiftly with transcripts and closed captions.
- Have an inclusion programme whenever we have paid activities which awards free tickets to those who would be otherwise unable to attend.
- Enforce a Code of Conduct in all community spaces we operate.
