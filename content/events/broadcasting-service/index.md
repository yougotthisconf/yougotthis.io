  :speakers='[people["praveena-fernandes"]]'
  description="Leadership often involves wading through tough waters when there's minimal direction and feedback. It especially becomes difficult when feedback is often used as a tool to assess whether you are doing a good job and find areas where you could improve/thrive in the future. Getting quality feedback is hard during the best of times let alone when you are in a position where there's a power imbalance and you may not get honest useful feedback from your team, it is far worse when people above you may not have time to give you actionable feedback for you to be effective in your job. This talk helps equip you with tools to bridge some of that gap when there are seemingly lots to improve on but no clear path ahead and how to find help when there's often none.">

  description="The first few years in any new career is daunting. It can feel isolating and overwhelming if there isn't someone to shadow or tap on the shoulder when things get hard. However, you don't know what you don't know. This is made further complicated with remote office culture and navigating teams spread over different time zones and different cultures and markets. Teams need to be intentional in how they onboard these new hires. We will walkthrough the strategies to establish good remote workflows and communication. This talk is for anyone with interns and junior contributors on their team. I also aim to help new hires make sure they know what they need to know when starting out in their new roles.">

  description="In literature, the protagonist's journey depicts a sequence of thematic events that lead to a hero discovering their calling and going on a journey -  saving the world or training a dragon. We can use the stages of the Hero's Journey to craft our own stories as developers, from finding our passion, understanding our strengths and weaknesses, planning a trajectory for growth, and sharing our stories. A personal narrative inspires confidence and helps individuals share their contributions, motivations, and aspirations in interviews, networking, or when looking for new opportunities.

  :speakers='[people["bekah-hawrot-weigel"]]'
  description="Sometimes apologies don't quite *feel* right, and it can be hard to figure out why. Often, it's because they weren't really apologies; they were performances made to deflect responsibility, excuse away behavior, and with the hopes of calming negative feelings. Whether you've received one of these types or given them yourself, this talk will allow you to recognize what makes a good and authentic apology and how to construct one yourself. ">
